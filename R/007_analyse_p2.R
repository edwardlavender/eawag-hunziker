#### Implement modelling 

#### Fit models
# We will fit a model of day ~ sex * length
# * We expect migration timing to be delayed (larger) for smaller individuals 
# ... earlier migrants should be larger
# ... later migrants may be smaller (minimise predation risk)
# * We expect this decline to be faster for females
# ... I.e., small females will risk migration sooner than males
# ... of the equivalent size 

# mod_1: Initial model: sex-specific smoothers of length (with varying wiggliness)
# ... This model is closest to our hypothesis in that it allows M/F to vary in timing by size
mod_1 <- gam(migration_yday ~ 
               sex +
               s(length, by = sex, bs = "tp", m = 2) + 
               s(yday, bs = "cc") + 
               s(stream, bs = "re"), 
             knots = list(yday = c(0, 365)),

               sex +
               s(log(length), by = sex, bs = "tp", m = 2) +

# mod_3: individual sex AND stream specific smoothers (for effect of length)
# The initial models (e.g., mod_1) describe the data reasonably well 
# ... on average across streams but the predictions for individual streams
# ... are poor. There is evidence that the shape of the relationship between migration
# ... timing by body size varies substantially by stream; while normally negative
# ... the steepness of the shape varies. This suggests a model with effects that
# ... vary by stream would be appropriate. 
# Thus we amend the previous model to permit sex/stream specific smoothers

# mod_4: mod_3 but with stream-specific smoothers only 
# According to AIC, this similar model is preferable
# I.e., the effect of size is similar between the sexes
# Putting P1 and P2 together, we can say that 
# * Females, and especially small females, are more likely to migrate than similarly sized males
# * Of the individuals that do migrate, larger individuals migrate sooner than smaller ones
# * Of the migrants, females do not appear to migrate sooner than males of equivalent size
